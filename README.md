# Fibonacci

Everyone's favorite [number sequence...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

This assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion) tests both iterative and recursive methods for outputting a section of the fibonacci sequence.

I also included an extra example of recursion that only returns a specific position in the fibonacci sequence, but makes it easier to comprehend.
